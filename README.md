# My Twitter Archive

This is the source repo for my jimkennedy twitter account, from which I shouted into the void for 14 years. You can listen to my howling, and the void's muted responses, at https://jimken123.github.io/twitter/.

I build this mostly using [tweetback](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback) from [zachleat](https://github.com/zachleat), who was very helpful on [Mastodon](@zachleat@zachleat.com).

I also used some tweaks from [Raúl Piracés](https://github.com/piraces), taken from this [blog post](https://piraces.dev/posts/twitter-own-archive-updated/).
